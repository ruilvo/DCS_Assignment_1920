\section{Introduction}

It is rather intuitive that different (de)modulation schemes have different
performance when subject to similar channel conditions. In this study, we compare
the performance of M-PSK, M-QAM and M-FSK modulations in the presence of additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN), with and without using error correction techniques,
and over multipath channels. But first, let us define and explore all these
things.

\subsection{PSK modulation}

The first modulation scheme studied is phase-shift keying modulation, usually
shortened to PSK modulation. Formally, it works by encoding one bit or groups of
bits, called symbols, in phase-shifts of a carrier wave. In essence, a PSK signal
can be described by the following formulation:
\begin{equation}
    s_{\text{PSK}}(t) = \cos \left( 2\pi f t + 2\pi n/M \right)
\end{equation}
where \(M\) is the number of different symbols being keyed, called the modulation
order, and \(n = \{0,\ldots,M-1\}\) is the symbol being keyed, which would be
itself a function of time.

While this formulation describes well the behaviour in RF signals, at baseband we
have to be more careful, and resort to a complex exponential notation. In this
case, we can describe PSK as:
\begin{equation}
    s_{\text{PSK}}(t) = e^{2\pi j n/M}
\end{equation}
This leads to an interesting interpretation of PSK\@: what we are doing is
choosing one out of a series of discrete points in the unit circle in the complex
plane. To these points we call a constellation. The modulation order, \(M\) is
equal to the number of points in this circle.

It is also important to discuss how to assign digital information to these
aforementioned symbols. The natural thing to do is to assign each symbol to a
particular bit pattern. This leads that modulation orders should be chosen as
powers of two and, for a modulation order \(M\) each symbol carries
\(\log_{2}(M)\) bits. In assigning each symbol to a particular bit pattern, it is
usual to use Gray coding, meaning that each symbol differs from it's neighbours by
only one bit. Figure~\ref{fig:pskfig} illustrates these concepts.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{QPSK_Gray_Coded.png}
    \caption{Constellation diagram for QPSK (4-PSK) with Gray
        coding~\cite{wikipskconst}.

            Unported}.\label{fig:pskfig}}
\end{figure}

Finally, it is worth discussing the process of getting the symbols back from the
transmitted signal, at the receiving end. If the signal is contaminated with noise
(and it will generally be), the phase of the signal gets harder to determine. In
particular, it's not expected that the phase matches exactly the one of any of the
symbols. A simple method to solve this is to choose a symbol whose phase is
closest to the one measured.

\subsubsection{Error rate vs noise for PSK}

Figure~\ref{fig:pskser} describes the probability of symbol error (SER) for PSK
modulation.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{pskser}
    \caption{SER for PSK with different modulation orders. Adapted from the class
        documents~\cite{slidesaulas}\label{fig:pskser}.}
\end{figure}
These curves are fairly easy to understand. If we look back into the
constellation, we'll notice that the frequency step between adjacent symbols is
smaller for higher modulation orders. If the modulator decides on the symbol by
choosing whichever is closest, a certain phase shift caused by noise has a higher
probability to cross a decision boundary when these decision regions are smaller.
For completion sake, the approximate analytical expression for these curves is
given by~\cite{slidesaulas}:
\begin{equation}
    P_e = 2Q \left( \sqrt{\frac{2E_s}{N_0}}\sin\frac{\pi}{M} \right)
\end{equation}

\subsection{QAM modulation}

Quadrature amplitude modulation, or QAM, can be seen as an extension to PSK\@ (or
the latter as a particular case of the former). Instead of selecting points in the
unit circle for our constellation, we select our points ``arbitrarily'' in the
complex plane, leading to both phase and amplitude modulation. Let
\(S_{\text{QAM}}\) be the set of symbols (points in the complex plane) that define
the constellation. A QAM signal in baseband would be described as:
\begin{equation}
    s_{\text{QAM}}(t) = \left|S_{\text{QAM}}[n] \right| e^{2\pi j
            \angle S_{\text{QAM}}[n]}
\end{equation}
where \(n = \{1,\ldots,M-1\}\), is the index of a symbol in the set. It is usual
to prefer square QAM shapes, leading to modulation indexes that are powers of 4,
albeit any constellation can be defined. Figure~\ref{fig:qamconst} illustrates
typical QAM constellations.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Square-QAM-constellation-diagrams.png}
    \caption{Typical constellations for QAM signals. Adapted from~\cite{Pfau2009}\label{fig:qamconst}.}
\end{figure}

Similarly to what is done with PSK, in a QAM demodulator the decision on the
symbol during demodulation can be done by choosing whatever is closest to the
measured signal. Since both amplitude and phase are at play in QAM, the use of IQ
demodulators is of great help, transforming this problem into a problem of two
phases.

\subsubsection{Error rate vs noise for QAM}

The behaviour of bit and symbol error rated for QAM is very similar to the one for
PSK, for the same reasons. The bit error probability for QAM modulation is given
by:
\begin{multline}
    P_{b, \text{QAM}} = \frac{4}{\log_2 M}
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{M}}  \right) Q
    \\
    \sqrt{\frac{3 \log_2 M}{M-1} \frac{E_b}{N_0}}
\end{multline}

\subsection{FSK Modulation}

Frequency-shift keying, or FSK, works a bit different from the previous ones.
Instead of encoding information into multiplying a carrier signal by a
complex-valued factor, we instead frequency-shift the carrier signal altogether.
At baseband level, an FSK signal can be described as:
\begin{equation}
    s_{\text{FSK}}(t) = e^{2\pi j\times n/M \times \Delta f_{\text{MAX}}}
\end{equation}
where \(n = \{1,\ldots,M-1\}\) is a number corresponding to the symbol to the
transmitted, \(M\) is the modulation index (and maximum number of symbols) and
\(\Delta f_{\text{MAX}}\) is the maximum frequency shift of the signal.

\subsubsection{Error rate vs noise for FSK}

Figure~\ref{fig:fskser} describes the probability of symbol error for FSK
modulation.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fskser}
    \caption{SER for FSK with different modulation orders. Adapted from the class
        documents~\cite{slidesaulas}\label{fig:fskser}.}
\end{figure}
It's interesting to see that with FSK the probability of symbol error is actually
smaller for higher order modulation orders, given a positive SNR\@. While this may
seem surprising at first, there is an explanation. We can imagine that, similarly
to a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the frequencies between the carrier frequency
and the maximum signal frequency signal are divided into \(N\) frequency``bins''.
For high modulation order, these bins are ever smaller. This means that they will
``integrate'' a smaller bandwidth of noise, resulting in less noise energy in the
bin. At the same time, the power of the signal transmitting the symbol itself is
the same, resulting in higher ``contrast''. The drawback to use high modulation
orders is the need to very accurate frequency matching between the transmitter and
the receiver. The approximate analytical expression for these curves is given
by~\cite{slidesaulas}:
\begin{equation}
    P_e \leqslant (M-1)Q\left( \sqrt{\frac{E_s}{N_0}} \right)
\end{equation}


\subsection{A note on pulse shaping filters}

Doing simple PSK or QAM modulation per the equations given results in sharp
transitions of the carrier wave. These sharp transitions yield high (theoretically
infinite) bandwidth of the carrier signal in these transients. For the multipath
simulations especially, this is very important, as time delays were implemented
with an FFT-based algorithm (these is discussed in the appropriate section).
Therefore, for these simulations, it is important to apply a bandwidth limiting
filter. It is usual to use a pair of matched raised-cosine filters for these
modulations. This is what I did. MATLAB's own function to implement the
raised-cosine filter also has the advantage of oversampling the modulated symbols,
which was convenient.

For FSK, there are problems with the frequency shifts between symbols are not
phase-continuous. Fortunately, MATLAB's own FSK modulation function provides a
phase continuity option, which was used.

\subsection{OFDM modulation}

Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing modulation, or OFDM modulation for
short, works differently from the modulation schemes seen previously. As the name
implies, OFDM is not a modulation scheme \textit{per se} but rather a multiplexing
technique. On OFDM, digital data that was previously modulated by other modulation
schemes is multiplexed in frequency in a way that ensures orthogonality. This
means that subcarriers of the OFDM signal do not suffer from cross-talk, and
therefore there is no intersymbol interference. The orthogonality condition is
ensured if the subcarrier spacing is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta f = \frac{k}{T_S}
    \label{eq:subspace}
\end{equation}
where \(T_S\) is the symbol duration, and \(k\) is a positive integer. \(k=1\)
yields the lowest positive bandwidth.

Using subcarriers allows a system to achieve data throughputs equivalent to a very
high bandwidth single carrier system of other modulation types (like PSK and QAM)
but using subcarriers that themselves have relatively low baud rates. This is the
key for making OFDM resistant to multipath channels (to be discussed in a section
below). With the use of a guard interval, i.e., an extra time delay between
symbols, all the interference problems due to multipath effect that generate time
delays up to that interval are simply ignored. This trade-off is not important in
OFDM modulation since, as discussed, each subcarrier's baud rate is relatively
small so the effect of adding a guard interval doesn't result in dramatic changes
of data throughput.

\subsection{AWGN}

We will start by justifying Additive White Gaussian Noise as a good model for a
single path communication channel. The additive characteristic of AWGN models the
radiation that is present at the receiving end that does not relate to the signal
being transmitted. Without any further information, there is no reason to assume
that this noise would dependant in the frequency in any way. This is what is said
to be ``white'' noise. Finally, the source of this model is modelled as a random
source. By the central limit theorem, it's justifiable that the distribution for
this noise would be a Gaussian distribution. In fact, instead of saying that there
is a single noise source, the noise at a receiver can be modelled as an
arbitrarily large number of individual noise sources, giving strength to the
central limit theorem argument. In the context of this work, this AWGN will be
generated in a way that produces a determined signal-to-noise (SRN) ratio at the
receiver's ``input''. To compute that, we first compute the average sample energy
of the discrete-time transmitted signal, \(x_{\text{TX}}[n]\), of length
\(N{\text{s}}\) samples:
\begin{equation}
    E_{\text{s}} = \frac{1}{N{\text{s}}}\sum^{N{\text{s}}}_{n}
    \left|x_{\text{TX}}[n]\right|^{2}
\end{equation}
We then use this value and our target SNR to compute a noise spectral density,
\(N_0\):
\begin{equation}
    N_0 = \frac{E_{\text{s}}}{\text{SNR}}
\end{equation}
White Gaussian noise becomes fully characterized by it's variance,
\(\sigma_{\text{AWGN}}\):
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{\text{AWGN}} = \sqrt{N_0}
\end{equation}
We'll be performing only baseband simulations, using complex-valued signals. With
this in mind, our signal at the receiver, \(x_{\text{RX}}[n]\), becomes:
\begin{equation}
    x_{\text{RX}}[n] = x_{\text{TX}}[n] + \frac{\sigma_{\text{AWGN}}}{\sqrt{2}}
    \left( N[n] + jN[n] \right)
\end{equation}
where \(N[n]\) describes a concretization of a random variable with normal
distribution and \(j\) is the imaginary unit.

The work presented relies heavily on MATLAB's ``Communications
Toolbox''~\cite{comtoolbox}, which happens to include a function for this purpose,
\lstinline{awgn}~\cite{awgnfunc}. However, I did notice this function only adds
real-valued noise, leaving the imaginary part of signals intact. For the sake of
achieved a more correct behaviour, I used a custom function to add
AWGN~\cite{addawgnnoise}, included as the {\tt add\_awgn\_noise.m} file.

\subsection{Multipath channels}

Radio communication channel is said to be a multipath channel where the signal
transmitted reaches the receiver by two, or more, path. Effects of multipath
channels include coherent interference, that when destructive, can cause fading of
radio channels. Other effect is intersymbol interference, since the secondary
channels with be delayed relative to the dominant channel, the receiver will have
instants where it will receive conflicting information.

While models for OFDM channels can have some complexity, the scope of this work
focus mainly on the effect of channel delays. The simulation model will be
discussed in the results section, but the note is that it is admittedly
simplistic, but it allows for the analysis of the effects intended.

\subsection{Cyclic codes}

The first of the two error correction techniques studied in this work is the use
of cyclic codes. Cyclic codes are a particular type of linear block codes and the
characteristic of cyclic means that all code vectors of the block code are
obtained from each other by circular shifts.

The two important parameters for the context of these simulations are \(n\), the
code length (meaning the length of the ``output'' of the encoder) and \(k\), the
message length (meaning the length of the ``input'' of the encoder). Let then
\(d\) be the minimum distance of a cyclic code. That code can then detect up to
\(d-1\) errors and correct \((d-1)/2\) errors.

\subsection{Convolutional codes}

Convolutional codes work differently from cyclic codes. In convolutional codes
error correction, we add memory into the system, meaning that the output for each
input sequence depends not only on the present input but on the past of the
system.

This means that convolutional codes are described by three parameters: \(n\) and
\(k\) as before, and now \(K\), meaning the memory of the system. The
convolutional encoder then works basically as a state machine.

\section{Simulation and results}

\subsection{Exercise 1}

In question 1 we are asked to explore different modulation schemes, at different
modulation orders, analysing the bit error rate in relation to the power of
AWGN\@. This simulation is on the script {\tt simulation\_awgn.m} and makes heavy
use of the function defined on {\tt modem\_awgn.m}. For PSK, QAM and FSK modems,
the function modulates a random binary stream, upsamples the data using a Raised
Cosine filter for PSK and QAM, and for each target \(E_b/N_0\), it applies the
proper noise power, demodulates the signal and calculates the final BER\@.

For the sake of comparability, the independent variable in the simulation is the
relation \(E_b/N_0\). However, the function {\tt add\_awgn\_noise} takes a target
SNR as the argument. The equation that transforms between these quantities is
given by:
\begin{multline}
    \text{SNR dB} = \frac{E_b}{N_0} \text{ dB }
    + 10 \log_{10} \left( \log_2 (M) \right) \\
    - 10 \log_{10} (N_s)
\end{multline}
where \(N_s\) is the number of samples per symbol.

Figure~\ref{fig:pskberawgnres} shows the results for PSK modulation. The
theoretical curves were computed using the MALTAB function {\tt berawgn}. We see
good agreement between the curves. We see that 2-PSK (also called BPSK for binary)
and 4-PSK have pretty much the same BER curve.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{pdf/figure_1.pdf}
    \caption{BER for M-PSK modulation.\label{fig:pskberawgnres}}
\end{figure}
For higher order modulations, we see the BER get progressively worse for the same
\(E_b/N_0\), as expected and discussed in the introduction.

Figure~\ref{fig:qamberawgnres} shows the results for QAM modulation. The
conclusions are very similar to the case for PSK modulation.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{pdf/figure_2.pdf}
    \caption{BER for M-QAM modulation.\label{fig:qamberawgnres}}
\end{figure}

Finally, figure~\ref{fig:fskberawgnres} shows the results for FSK modulation.
Here, we see a good agreement for lower modulation orders, but higher order
modulations, especially for \(M=32\) gets worse. For the lower modulation orders
we see the behaviour discussed in the introduction: the BER is actually better for
higher modulation orders. This trend continues in the theoretical curves, but for
some reason that I couldn't figure out, practical results do not confirm this.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{pdf/figure_3.pdf}
    \caption{BER for M-FSK modulation.\label{fig:fskberawgnres}}
\end{figure}

Now that we have seen how each modulation scheme behaves in according to its
modulation index, it becomes interesting also to see how do they compare amongst
themselves. Figure~\ref{fig:compawgnres} shows exactly this. Keep in mind that not
all modulation orders where used for all modulation schemes. In the way that the
simulation was made, the same modulation order will yield the same bit rate, but
not necessarily the same bandwidth. If the latter is not a factor, this plot can
help us choose the best modulation technique, depending on the modulation order
one intends to use. We can see that for low modulation orders, like \(N=2\) and
\(N=4\), where QAM and PSK are nominally the same thing, they perform better than
FSK\@. However, for high modulation orders, FSK takes the lead as a best
modulation strategy.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{pdf/figure_10.pdf}
    \caption{BER for different modulations.\label{fig:compawgnres}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Exercise 2}

In exercise 2, we are prompted to study the effect of both cyclical and error
correction codes. We are to apply this correction methods to the previously
studied modulation schemes and see the variation in BER\@.

\subsubsection{Cyclic codes}

For the cyclic code study, I used two pairs of \((k,n)\) parameters: \(k=8\),
\(n=4\), and \(k=10\), \(n=2\). The polynomials for these parameters were
generated using the {\tt cyclpoly} function. Then, a parity-check matrix is
generated using the function {\tt cyclgen}. Finally, this parity-check matrix is
fed into the function {\tt syndtable} to produce the syndrome decoding table.
MATLAB's own {\tt encode} and {\tt decode} functions provide the interface to use
these elements into encoding the message and decoding the received bits.

For the \(k=8\), \(n=4\) pair of parameters, the minimum distance is 2, so the
maximum number of detectable errors is 1 and there is not the possibility of
correction, so we don't expect any improvements in relation to the previous case.
For \(k=10\) and \(n=2\), we do expect improvements: the minimum distance is 5, so
it's possible to detect up to 4 errors and decode up to two errors, so we do
expect some improvements.

Figures~\ref{fig:pskcrc},~\ref{fig:qamcrc}, and~\ref{fig:fskcrc}, show the results
for the different modulations.

% \end{figure}
Exactly as predicted, the \(k=8\), \(n=4\) parameters do not provide any benefit,
while \(k=10\) and \(n=2\) do provide significantly better error rates at the same
SNR due to the error correction.

\subsubsection{Convolutional codes}

To use convolutional codes for encoding messages in MATLAB, it's easy to use the
{\tt poly2trellis} function. It converts convolutional code polynomials to trellis
description. The the function {\tt convenc} encodes the data. Since there is no
trivial convolutional decoder, the function {\tt vitdec} provides a solution to
decode this data using the Viterbi algorithm.

Since there is no trivial way to design a specific convolutional encoder, I
settled on MATLAB's own suggestions~\cite{polytrel}. These are structures for a
1/2 Feedback Convolutional Encoder, a 2/3 Feedforward Convolutional Encoder and a
1/2 Feedforward Convolutional Encoder. The diagrams of the first of the two are in
figure~\ref{fig:convencs}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\columnwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]
        {Tre12FeedbackConvEncoderExample}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Two of the convolutional encoders studied. Adapted
        from~\cite{polytrel}.\label{fig:convencs}}
\end{figure}

The results are presented in figure~\ref{fig:resconv}. We see that in general we
get improved performance regarding the BER by using these encoders. However, it's
worth noting how the 2/3 feedforward convolutional encoder lags behind the
theoretical curve for no correction. This means that for some particular values of
SNR, the presence of this encoder makes thing worse. Also, funnily enough, we for
some modulation orders in FSK, this same encoder can't reach a state of zero
correction. I was not able to figure out the reasons behind this behaviour.

\subsubsection{All together}

For the sake of comparison, figure~\ref{fig:rescomb} shows the combined results of
both cyclic and convolutional encoding for each modulation. Results show how
careful design is important: cyclic encoding can be both useless of better than
the convolutional encoders studied. It all depends on the careful design and
analysis of the systems, demonstrating the importance of this kind of exploratory
work.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Exercise 3}

In exercise 3, we shift the focus from AWGN channels to multipath channels. In
particular, we are to look for the effect of intersymbol interference due to
interference between paths on a multipath channel. For the sake of having a
controlled experiment, I did not use any randomness in these simulations. What I
did was to add a delayed version of the signal to itself before decoding, with a
power adjustment. This power adjust is made enough for the effect of ISI to be
visible but not enough to drown the receiver's SNR\@. The results are presented in
figure~\ref{fig:delaysimp}. For scale, a symbol time is \SI{4}{\micro\second}. As
a hint for the study of ODM, it's important to mention the \SI{0.8}{\micro\second}
mark, as this coincides with the guard interval we are going to use. We see that
all modulations suffer from intersymbol interference before this mark. It's also
worth noting that this simulation only computes two paths. If one was to have the
superposition of \(N\) paths, the plot would not have just those small zones of
interference but basically show a flat erratic behaviour.

    \caption{BER in relation to excess time delay.\label{fig:delaysimp}}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Exercise 4}

Now, in exercise 4, we shift the focus to OFDM modulation. The assignment give us
parameters to implement this modem. However, MATLAB's OFDM function, like {\tt
ofdmmod} do not take into themselves the notion of time, or a sampling frequency.
So, I'll explain how this was implemented. I selected the number of subcarriers to
be 64, with the first 6 and last 6 left as empty subcarriers. This complies with
the requirement of 52 used subcarriers. At the same time, and referring to
equation~\ref{eq:subspace}, if we take the symbol time to be
\SI{3.2}{\micro\second} (this being the OFDM symbol duration minus the guard
interval), it will immediately yield a subcarrier spacing of
\SI{312.5}{\kilo\hertz}, and the required \SI{20}{\mega\hertz} of total bandwidth.
Finally, since the FFT size of the {\tt ofdmmod} function will be 64, then, the
required extra \SI{0.8}{\micro\second} of guard interval correspond to 16 extra
samples, which is the parameter that the function takes. Finally, the relation
between 64 samples and \SI{3.2}{\micro\second} indicates the need for a sampling
rate of exactly \SI{20}{\mega\sample\per\second}. This makes the function that
otherwise doesn't use any kind of frequency information specifically to comply
with the requested parameters.

The results for the excess time delay can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:delayofdm}.
Notice that we can clearly observe that there is no errors up to
\SI{0.8}{\micro\second} exactly, as predicted. For the sake of comparison,
figure~\ref{fig:delaycomp} shows a comparison between using the modulations from
previous exercises and using them on subcarriers of an OFDM signal. We can see the
improvements in BER up to the guard interval period. Keep in mind the previous
discussion on how the traditional plots would admittedly look worse for a channel
with more than two paths being compared.

\section{Conclusion}

Different modulation schemes have different behaviours. It is very important to do
a proper analysis of the channel conditions of the application and the necessary
data throughput before making any decisions. OFDM modulation provides a good way
to protect against channels that suffer from a multipath condition.
